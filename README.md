# 4Dtreeshape_project


Step-by-step-guide:
Step1:
We extracted skeletons from the pheno4D dataset using the algorithm []. 
Run to see the point clouds of the extracted skeletons

Step2:
Then we added branch layer information in those point cloud data. All those preprocessed data are saved in the dataset folder in .mat files. Where the filename is the date of capturing the sample data. Note: we warp out (removing some intermediate samples) some 4D growing plants for temporal registration purposes

Run to see the growing pattern of tomato plants with branch layer information (color-coded)
Run to see the growing pattern of maize plants with branch layer information (color-coded)

Step 3:
See the result of spatial registration. Here, color codes indicate the correspondences between branches

Run to see two growing patterns before and after spatial registration
Run to see those growing patterns after temporal registration

Step 4: 
Run to compute geodesic between two growing plants before spatiotemporal registration
Run to compute geodesic between two growing plants after spatiotemporal registration

Step 5:

Run to compute the mean of the shapes in the dataset 

Run to compute modes of variations of the shapes in the dataset 

Run to synthesize growing patterns
